# üîç Lost & Found System

The Lost & Found System is a structured, Python-based application integrated with SQL for data management. Designed as part of an academic database systems course, this project allows users to register, search, and manage lost and found items with ease. The system supports both command-line interaction and an optional GUI interface using Tkinter.

This project demonstrates core database design concepts, including schema modeling, SQL integration, and clean Python architecture. It follows a modular structure with separate layers for GUI, backend logic, and database configuration, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

Technologies used include Python 3.x, SQL, and basic GUI components for desktop-level usability. The codebase is easy to understand and extend, making it suitable for academic demos, small office use-cases, or internal organization tools.

Feel free to explore, clone, and build upon this project. Feedback and contributions are always welcome.
